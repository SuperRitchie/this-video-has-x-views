[![Video update](https://github.com/SuperRitchie/this-video-has-x-views/actions/workflows/update_video_title.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SuperRitchie/this-video-has-x-views/actions/workflows/update_video_title.yml)

This repository provides functionality inspired by Tom Scott's ["This Video Has 'x' Views"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0) video in the Python programming language.
It updates both the video title based on the number of views and the description based on the number of likes every 6 hours.

Correspondingly, the video_id, oauth token, client config from Google Cloud Platform must be provided for the code to run.
